I am an assistant professor at the Department of Social Work, National University of Singapore. I got my PhD from the [School of Social Work](https://ssw.unc.edu/), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For my postdoctoral training, I worked as a research fellow at the [Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/sics), A\*STAR and also at the [Social Service Research Centre](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/ssr/), NUS. Before I joined the academia, I was a social worker at Fei Yue Family Service Centre.

As a social work researcher, my research focuses on parenting, fathers, stepfamilies, and intervention research. I am also interested to advance the use of administrative data in the social service sector to improve social work practices and to evaluate interventions and services. I also hope to explore the use of technology to support social work practices. 

I identify as a quantitative methodologist where the through line connecting my research interests involved the use of computational social science methods and advanced statistical methods. I am most interested to use text-as-data methods to explore insights from textual data generated from unconventional sources.
