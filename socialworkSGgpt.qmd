\*\* STILL IN IMPROVEMENT \*\*\*

The **Social Work Singapore Q & A Assistant** (currently) allows you to query the [Code of Professional Ethics for Social Work Profession Singapore](https://sasw.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SASW-Code-of-Professional-Ethics-3rd-Revision-online.pdf).

In your query, try to specifically include Singapore or social work. Use the app with discretion! 
**If you made any queries, let me know how it went so that I know how to improve this.** 
Give me feedback/ideas at: gerard\@nus.edu.sg.

Consider funding this app to adopt better models and host on faster cloud computers. Each of your query costs me $. A \$10 can fund about 250 queries (4 cents per query).

\
**Try it out. Ask questions like:**

-   What are the core values of ethical principles of social work in Singapore?
-   What social work ethical concerns are there regarding safekeeping clients' records in Singapore?
-   Can social workers in Singapore receive tips for services?
-   When was this code of practice developed and revised?
-   What are the most frequent verbs, adjectives, and nouns used in the code of professional ethics?

**Tips to prompts**

-   Ask for specificity to the Singapore code of ethics.
-   State the context e.g., Singapore social work.

**Future Plans**

-   Expand the data to query from: include local research studies, textbooks, practice guide, service info, professional-related documents (e.g., National Social Work Competency Framework)
-   Transform this app from a Q&A assistant to a chatbot!
-   A mailing list for you to subscribe to updates to the app
-   Integrate apps with other useful functions (e.g., draw genograms)
-   [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/gerardchung) so that I can do this at night after my wife/kids zzzz.
-   Or fund this app so that I can use better LLMS, powerful cloud hosting to get faster responses, etc

Additional note:

-   I am using my own \$ to sustain the app. Each of your query will cost me \$.
-   The \$ goes to using the Llama 2 LLM.
-   But i use free hosting from Huggingface with CPU power i.e., no GPUs :(
-   This is why the prompt is so slow to return.
